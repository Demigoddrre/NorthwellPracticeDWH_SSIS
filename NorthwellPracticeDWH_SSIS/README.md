# **NorthwellPracticeDWH_SSIS Project**

## **Overview**
The **NorthwellPracticeDWH_SSIS** project is designed to handle the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) workflows for the NorthwellPracticeDWH initiative. This project automates the ingestion, transformation, and loading of data into a star-schema-based Data Warehouse. It serves as a dedicated repository for managing SSIS packages, connection configurations, logs, and other resources required for data integration tasks.

## **Purpose**
This SSIS project automates the following tasks:
1. **Data Ingestion:**
   - Load raw data from CSV, Excel, or APIs into staging tables.
   - Configure connections to handle diverse data sources (e.g., flat files, SQL Server).
2. **Data Transformation:**
   - Cleanse and transform data for loading into fact and dimension tables.
   - Perform deduplication, typecasting, and validation using transformations in SSIS.
3. **Data Loading:**
   - Automate loading of transformed data into fact and dimension tables using SSIS workflows.
4. **Logging and Monitoring:**
   - Log ETL activities into flat files (`Logs/`) and the Data Warehouse log table.
   - Notify stakeholders via email in case of errors (optional).
5. **Scalability:**
   - Enable reusable and modular SSIS components to simplify workflows across projects.

## **How to Use**

### **1. Setup**
- **Prerequisites**:
  - SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) installed and configured.
  - SQL Server Database configured for the NorthwellPracticeDWH.
  - Flat files or other data sources placed in the appropriate directories (e.g., `Samples/`).

- **Connection Configuration**:
  - Update `.dtsConfig` files in the `Connections/` folder with the correct database connection strings and file paths.

### **2. Running Packages**
- Open the `NorthwellPracticeDWH.sln` solution file in Visual Studio Community.
- Navigate to the specific project (e.g., `Project1_ClaimsDataAnalysis`).
- Run the desired SSIS package:
  - `LoadClaims.dtsx`: Loads raw claims data into staging tables.
  - `TransformClaims.dtsx`: Cleanses and transforms staging data.
  - `LoadToFactDim.dtsx`: Loads transformed data into fact and dimension tables.

### **3. Logging**
- Execution logs are written to:
  - **Flat files**: Found in the `Logs/` directory of each project.
  - **Database log table**: Check the Data Warehouse log table for historical records of ETL activities.

### **4. Reusability**
- Shared components like the `LoggingFramework.dtsx` package can be found in the `Shared/CommonPackages/` directory for use across multiple projects.

## **Workflow Example: Project 1 (Claims Data Analysis)**

### **Step 1: Configure Connections**
- Update `ClaimsDatabase.dtsConfig` with the appropriate SQL Server connection string.
- Update `ClaimsFlatFile.dtsConfig` with the file path for the `SampleClaims.csv`.

### **Step 2: Run SSIS Packages**
1. **Load Raw Data**: Execute `LoadClaims.dtsx` to ingest raw claims data into staging tables.
2. **Transform Data**: Run `TransformClaims.dtsx` to cleanse and map the data.
3. **Load Fact/Dim Tables**: Execute `LoadToFactDim.dtsx` to populate the Data Warehouse.

### **Step 3: Validate Results**
- Verify data in staging, fact, and dimension tables in the Data Warehouse.
- Check execution logs for errors or warnings.

---

## **Tools Required**
- **SQL Server Developer Edition** (with SSIS and SSDT).
- **Visual Studio Community Edition** with SSIS extensions.
- **Power BI Desktop** for visualizations (optional).

---

## **Future Enhancements**
- Integrate Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD) for historical tracking.
- Add support for API-based data ingestion.
- Deploy SSIS packages to SQL Server for automated scheduling.

---

## **Notes**
- This project is modular, and each project directory is self-contained for its specific ETL tasks.
- For reusable components and shared configurations, refer to the `Shared/` directory.
- For additional documentation, see the `Documentation/` folders in each project.
